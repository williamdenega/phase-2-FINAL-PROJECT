# PHASE 2 FINAL PROJECT (REACT)

# Description

This project was created to display my ability and understanding of react. This project named "Pet Liker" (very creative name, I know) is a simple single page application that has over 5 components that I used to try to keep my code well organized. It also includes at least 3 client-side routes using React Router (https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) that helps you navigate the webpage. 

In essance, what Pet Liker does, is uses 2 API's to fetch random images of either dogs or cats, depending on your choice. You can scroll through the images and "like" the images that you like and it will save(POST) that image onto a db.json file. You then have access to a "favorites" tab, where you can then see the images(pets) that you have liked (with an option to delete them). 



## Getting Started

**You need to install JSON Server to get started**

### `npm install -g json-server`

Installs JSON Server into your local machine.


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### `json-server --watch db.json`

Launches the REST API for the favorites page. 


## API's Used

In the webpage, I used 2 API's. One for random cats, and one for the random dogs.

CAT API - https://api.thecatapi.com

DOG API - https://dog.ceo/
